# KeysCMS
KeysCMS is something I am building for my own use that I will also be releasing to the public as an Open Source Project that caters to the Cryptocurrency industry.
## Another CMS?
In short, yes! Why? Because nothing exist for my "All in one" needs for creating and managing a high traffic network of Cryptocurrency based websites and mobile apps.
## Project Status
I am a newly single father that got set back a bit when going through a rough divorce that is now a thing of the past. This project is going to be the heartbeat of how I make a living. I am going into this full time and broke!
## Features - TODO
* Numerous Crypto Web Based and Mobile tools.
* Crypto Website widgets that you can place on remote domains as well as your own.
* Multi-Site Features
* Internal API for wallet balance and transactions. ***YOUR OWN WALLET BALANCE API!!!!***
* Website Pages & Custom Pages Builder - Drag and drop your way to your own custom blockchain explorer featured website.
* Numerous Ways To Monetize.
* Crypto Only Search Engine With Crawler/Indexer
* Self Serve Advertising Platform.
* Newsletter Management.
* Feature Packed Admin Backend.
* SEO & Mobile Driven.

* And so much more....
## Sponsors & Funding
I am in serious need of a little bit of funding and I am offering to entertain future advertising deals with very cheap CPC and also including your brand or project on my "Friends" pages platform wide that would come with obvious SEO benefits.
I will gladly accept BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH & DOGE and you would be making a difference to my life in a very good way as this has been a dream venture that got set back due to unfortunate events.
